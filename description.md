At first, we looked at our first task, there we created a phishing site manually.
Then we searched for how we could automate this process, we thought with AI, but when we checked that AI is so much stronger for a task like that we decided to go on a different route.

So we created a website, where you can put a URL of a desired website, and our code will scrape the desired website, to make a phishing site, we achieved the URL changes in the website, which were done by changing the tag attributes.

Afterward, we created a page where you can see you have been phished, so we will succeed in our project to raise awareness about phishing attacks and websites.

To avoid legal charges we decided to add warnings and steps to do after the user got phished and entered his data, and let the user have the ability to delete his details.
