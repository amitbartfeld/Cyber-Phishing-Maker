            <p>This project was created by Amit Bartfeld and Orel Pashayev. To rise phishing awareness.</p>
            <p>We made this website to show people how easy it is to create a phishing site, from any website they know
                on the internet.</p>
            <p>This project was made using Python, HTML, JS, and CSS. <br> It's our final project for cyber security
                course in college.</p>
            <p>We hope this project will help spread awareness for phishing and will help people to protect themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for using our project.</p>
